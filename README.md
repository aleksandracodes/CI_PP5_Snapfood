## Design

### Colours

The colour scheme for this application was inspired by the pallet found on [Pinterest](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/75/60/95/7560957eb677f91110b4677515b911db.jpg). It was the aim to keep the colours neutral and warm to create a calming feeling and gather user's focus on the photographs without distraction by other graphics on the website. App background color is light (gainsboro) grey with matching navbar and the containers with the main content are white. Action buttons, highlight of text and search bar have contrasting colour of darker schade of 'salmon'. Bootstrap 'secondary' variant was also used, eg. for the post category badges.
These colours were used throughout all the pages in such a way as to ensure adequate contrast and good user experience.

<img src="docs/readme/color-scheme-snapfood.jpg">

### Fonts

Google Fonts were implemented on the website. Inter with sans-serif as fallback was used thoughout the site to ensure high legibility of the content.
Inter features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case text.

## Front-End

### React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its primary goal is to make it easy to reason about an interface and its state at any point in time, by dividing the UI into a collection of independent and reusable components ([source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-react-handbook-b71c27b0a795/)).

There were various components created and reused across this application.

- `<Asset />` - multipurpose reusable compontent which displays different versions of the component depending on the props we pass to it. 
  - loading spinner (from React Bootstrap) when content is being loaded
  - image with src and alt attribute
  - paragraph with a message

- `<Avatar />` - resuable component, used to render profile images in the UI. Passed props allow for setting image source and size and adjust image dimensions depending on where the component is rendered. Example of use include the `<NavaBar />` component, Post page or the Profile page. On mobile screens Avatar component within the Profile Page will be significantly bigger than on other screen sizes.

- `<DropdownMenu />` - reusable component, used to render the dropdown menu which allows user to edit or delete their own posts orcomments, and also edit their profile or change profile password.

- `<FeedbackMsg />` - component for displaying feedback messages to the user upon editing/deleting comments, deleting post, updating profile information or a password.

- `<Landing />` - specific component for displaying a landing page for new / not logged-in users, which contains links to sign up and log in, in addition to the navbar.

- `<LikeFeedAddPost />` - reusable component containing 3 icons to add a post, show liked post or show posts by profiles the users follows. Displayed on various pages of the app.

- `<NavBar />` - reusable component with the content depending on the login status of the user. For logged in user it shows icon link to the main posts page and user avatar/picture. For those who are not logged in, it displays icon links to sign up or log in instead of the avatar. The component is used on each page of the app.

- `<PageNotFound />` - specific component for displaying a 404 graphic error message with a return to menu button when user enters the url which does not exist.

- `<PasswordCriteria />` - reusable component containing password criteria which are displayed on button hoover or focus. Used on sign up page and profile password change page.

- `<PopularProfiles />` - reusable component showing first three most followed profiles in the app. The component displays user avatar, name and follow/unfollow button. These buttons are hidden on medium screen size devices. The component is used across the app together with the `<LikeFeedAddPost />` component and post categories badges on relevant pages.

## Future features / improvements

Example of potential improvements to this project:

  - Allow user authentication with already existing accounts, e.g. LinkedIn, Google, etc. 
- Profile
  - Option to send a message to other user
- Posts
  - Additional field to include the recipe of the dish
  - Show most liked posts in the app - similar to â€˜Top Usersâ€™ menu
- Comments
  - Option to reply to a selected comment and create a conversation
  - Option to like/unlike other usersâ€™ comments

I was initially planning to have the functionality to delete user account but I decided to keep all the signed-up users within the database and do not allow them to remove their profile.
